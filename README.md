# BusRidershipPrediction
This is a data science course project at Fall 2022 associated with Seattle university.
In this project bus ridership prediction models were build, along with preprocessing and accuracies for different datasets with different models were calculated.

Problem statement: We are focusing on the question; how many buses are needed to cover the ridership needs a given route? Our model willhelp predict how many riders will use a given route on a given day so that the number of buses run on that day will better fit expected ridership. Our model uses year, month, day type (weekday, weekend, or holiday),and historical weather datato help better predict ridership levels.
